# Semester 3 JavaScript Shooter Repository

## Greetings

This code is now completed. I comment my code so that it is more easily understandable.
All my sources of tutorials and snippets I used can be found at the bottom of each script file. 

If you encounter any other errors, you can reach me at git.

## Name
**Project JavaScript Shooter**

## Description
A test game to refresh my memory and see if I can make a 3D Shooting gallery game inside the browser. Featuring custom models, sounds and some basic gameplay.

## Installation
Clone repository is the way to go. You need to download git from [Git SCM](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)

## Usage 
Start the game by opening the .html file in your browser running on a local server. 

**Warning:** You can only play this game when you run a local server. If you do not do this, the browser will fail to load the three.js plugin. 

## Support
Send me a message on git.

## Roadmap
+ **November 2023:** Setting up the base scene
+ **December 2023:** Version 0.5
+ **January 2024:** Version 1.0 stable

## Contribution
This project is a one-man project, and I am not looking for assistance to learn more on my own. Various teachers on Fontys ICT helped me in the process.

## Licence

## Project Status
Presentable as of January 2024.
